# PythonianFLOORIT
This program presents the user with a dilemma, where they have started to FLOOR IT from 0 out of a parking lot, 4 seconds go by without alert. Then you get an alert that there is an obstacle 40 feet ahead! You can only slow 8 ft per second, however. The program tells you the speed of you accelerating for the first four seconds and then your speed per second as you try to accelerate to zero before hitting the obstacle. The program then tells you if you hit the obstacle or not. 
The main purpose of this program is to practice using control structures, classes, functions, iteration, operators, and expressions. Several different types of control structures were used including for and while loops as well as range and if/then functions. Different functions were called both in the class and in the main function. 
The math in the program is not exact to real life physics. The acceleration occurs linearly according to the zerotosixty total acceleration time. The deceleration is constant at 8 ft/sec. The program should not be used for real physics applications, but for general practice to become a better programmer specifically in python.
